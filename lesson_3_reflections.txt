When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

For sharing and working collaboratively with others; for distributing code; for backup/availability across 
machines. 

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

Other users may have pushed content to Github, and I may not want their updates.
