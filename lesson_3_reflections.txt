When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

For sharing and working collaboratively with others; for distributing code; for backup/availability across 
machines. 

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

Other users may have pushed content to Github, and I may not want their updates.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?

A fork is making a copy of someone else's repository in your own account on Github (so you don't muck up their repository). Cloning is making a copy of a repository, other than forking (for making a copy of a github or other repository). A branch is a new part of an existing repository (e.g., new features, experiments)

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote stored locally?

In case you don't have ready access to the remote, and want to know what the effect of pushing changes would 
be, whether conflicts may need to be resolved, etc.

How would you collaborate without using Git or GitHub? What would be easier, and what would be harder?

You could email stuff to each other or use dropbox, or work collaboratively with toold like Google Docs. Github is likely
easier, because it's set up to provide diffs, manage coding workflow, etc.
